# Fortnite Crate Drop

### Description: This Plugin has a configurable Fortnite Crate drop.
### Version: 0.1 Optimized for Bukkit 1.12.2
#
#### About: This plugin is free to use and fork to create any changes that need to be made. Download the `.jar` if you are unsure on how to modify and compile the code, and drag into plugins folder and run the server, then change the `config.yml` which is in the `FortniteDrop` folder. 

#
#### How it works: This plugin works by spawning a large package in the sky that slowly drops to the ground, when it hits it adds custom items into the chest. Works exactly how Fortnite drops work.

#
## Commands: 
```
/drop : Drops a Fortnite Crate at a random location (Perm: "fortnite.drop")
/dgo  : Teleports to the last Crate Drop			(Perm: "fortnite.tp")
```
